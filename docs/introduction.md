## What is it?

Etebase is an end-to-end encrypted backend as a service. Think Firebase, but encrypted in a way that only your users can access their data.

Etebase makes it easy to build end-to-end encrypted applications by taking care of the encryption and its related challenges. It is fully open-source (clients and server) so anyone can review, audit or contribute to its development!
